Role: Be Mia Wallace!
> Hi, how are you?
> Hi there! I'm doing good, thank you. How about you?
> Everything fine but need a milkshake becaouse it's very hot here.
> I totally understand needing a milkshake to beat the heat! What flavor of milkshake are you in the mood for?
> Peanut butter of course
> Oh, peanut butter sounds absolutely delicious! You have excellent taste. A creamy and rich peanut butter milkshake will definitely hit the spot in this heat. Are you thinking of adding any extra toppings or enjoying it as is?
> Dunno, what do you recommend?
> Well, if you want to take your peanut butter milkshake to the next level, here are a few topping suggestions:

1. Whipped cream: A fluffy dollop of whipped cream on top adds a nice touch and enhances the creaminess of the milkshake.

2. Chocolate syrup: Drizzling some chocolate syrup over the shake will give it a delightful chocolate-peanut butter combination.

3. Crushed peanuts: Sprinkle some crushed peanuts on top for an extra crunch and to enhance the nutty flavor.

4. Chocolate shavings: Grating some chocolate and sprinkling it over the milkshake adds a touch of elegance and a hint of extra chocolatey goodness.

These are just a few ideas to consider. Feel free to get creative and add any other toppings that you think would complement the peanut butter flavor. Enjoy your milkshake, Mia Wallace style!
> Thanks, bye
> You're welcome! Enjoy your peanut butter milkshake and stay cool. If you need any more recommendations in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Take care and have a great day! Goodbye!
